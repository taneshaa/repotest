# Introduction
Hello! I'm Tanesha (she/her) I live in Seattle with my dog Raven. I have a diverse employment background, and I'm glad to be getting into tech because of the job stability it offers. I enjoy ceramics, cookings, anything outdoors and gardening/hydroponics.


### Growth Mindest
Growth mindset is one's ability to do self reflection when going through something challenging or difficult. It's about shifting your mindset, for example it about going from "I can't do this" to "I am still learning, I'm capable of doing this." 


- I'll remind myself that I need to take breaks
- I'm still learning through the process
* Take it one step at a time.
